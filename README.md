This Application is a Newsletter about React, in which the user can register using his GitHub account and in order for the user to be able to read the posts, he must be a subscriber. This application was built using Next.js, and for payment, the Stripe API was used, using Axios for the communication of the API, in the case of the backend a Serverless application was used, using FaunaDB, and for the creation and publication of Posts, a CMS was used, in this case, the Prismic CMS.
